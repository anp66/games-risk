It is great to see you would want to improve Game::Risk.
Here is what you need:

* Dist::Zilla
* Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::JQUELIN


Code layout:

Each window has its own module in 

    lib/Games/Risk/GUI/


Translation files are in 

    lib/LocaleData/<language code>/LC_MESSAGES/Games-Risk.po

So for example the French translation is in

    lib/LocaleData/fr/LC_MESSAGES/Games-Risk.po

The file holding the strings is here:

    lib/LocaleData/Games-Risk-messages.pot
